Analysis and Prediction of Cardiovascular Risk Using Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models

Objective: To determine model appropriate for predicting cardiovascular disease in 30–50-year-olds
• Performed Data Cleaning, Feature engineering and Data Transformation using Python.
• Applied 5 ML models- Random Forest, AdaBoost, Logistic regression, SVM and XGBoost- to determine the optimal model for prediction of CVD in the target population.

Outcome: Based on the dataset SVM is the most optimal model for CVD prediction with 72.2% accuracy.
